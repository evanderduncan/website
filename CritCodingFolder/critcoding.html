                <p>Icons Made Without Hands is a reference to the Medieval term Acheiropoieta, meaning ‘not made by hands’. Acheiropoieta are Christian icons that have miraculously come into existence, discovered by humans and act, for some, as evidence of divine agency. 

                    Seeing machines represent a new acheiropoieta, they make images without hands. Seeing machines describe both the ways humans use technology to “see” the world and the ways machines see the world for other machines. Seeing machines are cameras that make data images without hands. Through a massive network of automation they ‘magically’ generate imprints that feel like new photographs. These machines are shedding light on a new reality of emerging data worlds. Not only are cameras capturing this world of data but are themselves becoming embedded in it. They have shed their glass optical lenses and dispersed themselves as an ambient sensing layer of pure data. 
                    
                    This new acheiropoieta symbolises the next step in the procession of image making techniques, moving away from the material world of painting and photography into one of abstracted data.  
                    
                    Icons Made Without Hands represents this procession of image making. Merging the traditional medium of landscape painting with the automated data collection, breakdown, and creation of seeing machines to create a contemporary computational scene.
